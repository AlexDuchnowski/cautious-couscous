# Notes

## TODOs

- Add pixel/fixel styling
- Add more levels
- Make level progression teach mechanics intuitively

## Feedback

- Getting stuck sucks
  - Resetting isn't fun
  - Preferable to have it auto-reset in some way if a player gest stuck
  - It could also be that none of the levels have areas in which you can get stuck
- Current progression/introduction of mechanics is a little fast
- Clean/minimal interface is a plus
